"    Then a voice speaks, louder than an earthquake. It seems to echo inside your bones and from the very "
"centre of the galaxy. \"Oh crap...\" it says.\n"
"    Another voice laughs musically, as if world itself were singing. \"bobbens, did you just destroy the "
"universe, again?\"\n"
"    \"Mmmm, hold on,\" the first voice rumbles. \"...SIGSEGV... libc start main+0xe5... ah ha!  There's the "
"problem.\"  You feel something fundamental in the fabric of reality change. The sensation is like sneezing "
"and hiccuping at the same time. \"There, that should fix it.\"\n"

"the height of eternity.\n"

"As you take the last empty seat at the table, Colonel Urnus starts the meeting. \"Welcome, citizen. You know "
"why you are here and you know what this meeting is about, so let me get right to the point. We have reason to "
"believe the FLF terrorists are operating from a secret base of operations. We know this base is located "
"somewhere in the nebula, and we have recently uncovered intel that indicates the base is likely to be in the "
"{sys} system.\"\n"
"    One of the walls lights up, showing part of the galaxy map. The {sys} system is coloured red, and it's "
"pulsating gently.\n"
"    \"Of course, we have conducted patrols in this system, but so far without result. Our sensors are "
"severely impaired by the nebula in this system, so the chances of us finding the terrorist hive by our own "
"devices are slim. Fortunately, our top strategists have come up with a ruse, one that will make the FLF come "
"to us.\"\n"
"    \"We will use a civilian ship - your ship, naturally - as a decoy,\" Urnus continues. The image on the "
"wall zooms up to the {sys} system, and a white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. "
"\"Your ship will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who isn't looking too "
"closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know "
"where their base is, since you look like one of them. It is important to note that the transponder will work "
"best in the Nebula, which we believe is where the base should be located.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets will jump in and open fire. To the "
"FLF, it will look like one of their own has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will "
"undoubtedly send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""

"then access the ship's computer and download the flight log, which should contain the location of the FLF "
"base. Take this information to a Dvaered base, and your mission will be complete.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates one last time, simulating the battle as described by Colonel Urnus. Several "
"FLF logos appear, which are promptly surrounded by the Dvaered ones. Then the logos turn gray, indicating "
"that they've been disabled.\n"
"    \"Let me make one thing clear, citizen. You are allowed, even expected, to fire on the Dvaered ships that "

"    Colonel Urnus seems to have concluded his explanation, so you, having spotted the obvious flaw in the "

#. 2) Following Hamelsen towards Laars (main purpose of this is to let the player save the game because second part is tricky)

"\"Both squadrons of the DHC station's space security force will be deployed with a full range ships from "
"Vendettas to Goddards. Those squadrons are the 'Beta-Storks' and the 'Beta-Hammer' and their mission will be "
"to control medium and heavy ships and to provide heavy firepower in case of need. Our squadron, named 'Alpha-"
"NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts and Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.\n"
"   \"The plan is the following: any ship approaching the station will be assigned to a squad by the fleet "
"leader, and then to a pilot by the squad leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is assigned to you, you will "
"have to approach the ship within 1000m. Their security clearance code will be automatically requested and "
"processed by the system we'll install in your core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or "
"ordered to fly away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.\n"
"   \"Finally, in case something unexpected happens, you will, of course, have to obey orders. Watch your "
"messages closely. A few pilots will be kept in reserve close to the station.\n"
"   \"Oh, and there is another thing I must warn you about: it's the warlord's odd sense of humour. When they "
"see a small ship close to their Goddard, they may get the idea to shoot a small railgun-volley in your "
"direction. Some of them tend to enjoy seeing pilots fend for their lives. Dvaered law allows warlords to do "
"so provided they can assure the High Command that there was no hostile intention. That can be a bit annoying, "

#. -- Things don't go as expected and player has to intercept a ship (pretending to need fuel) and let the commandos board.
#. -- Afterwards, the player needs to kill a pirate shark with a Llama. Rem: if another dummy yacht gets added in the future, it could be added
#.
#. Stages :
#. 0) Way to Halir to search for the engine
#. 1) Way to Arcturus to intercept the transport Koala
#. 2) Interception of the Koala
#. 3) Way to Zhiru to deposit back the commandos
#. 4) Way to Zacron to get intercepted by the pirate Shark
#. 5) Battle

#. -- 5. Scavengers show up and talk about sensors not working well, talk through broadcast. Player has to follow without getting too close (maybe needs outfits to improve sensor range in nebula?)
#. -- 6. They lead the player to some debris and start looting. Player gets to talk to them and convince to leave, or kill them. Learns that Za'lek have been buying the goods.

#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defence force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.

#. MISSION: Hot dogs from space
#. DESCRIPTION: An old man who owns a hot dog factory wants to go to space
#.
#. The old man has elevated pressure in his cochlea so he can't go to space.
#. He's getting old and wants to go to space before he dies. He owns a hot dog
#. factory and will pay you in hot dogs (food). Because of his illness, you
#. can't land on any planet outside the system (the player doesn't know this).
#.
#. NOTE: This mission is best suited in systems with 2 or more planets, but can
#. be used in any system with a planet.
#.
#. --
#. luacheck: globals landed (Hook functions passed by name)
#. Note: this mission does not make any system claims.
#. If we're in mem.misn_base_sys but not on mem.misn_base then...
#. If we're in another system then make Reynir bleed out his ears ;)

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.
#. --
#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.
#. Whether the player opted to stop the script.
#.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.
#. Generate a deduplicated list.
